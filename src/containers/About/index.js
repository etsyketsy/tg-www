                    Twelve Gauge Records is an independent record label operating out of San Fransico, CA with a rich roster of hardcore and metal artists like Sabertooth Zombie, Power, Heavy Heavy Low Low, and others.
          <br></br><br></br>
                    The label was founded in 2004 with it's first release, Courtside Seats EP by Heavy Heavy Low Low, out in early 2005. Since then, over 20 artists put together a discography of over 30 releases mostly pressed on vinyl only.
          <br></br><br></br>
                    No two releases will sound alike as no effort is put into following a specific template or routine. This is a DIY effort with a strong passion for the music and the scene.
          <br></br><br></br>
                    Twelve Gauge Records is exclusively distributed by <a href="http://deathwishdirect.com">Deathwish Direct</a>.
